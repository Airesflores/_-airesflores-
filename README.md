Did the GIT is useful to the Programmers and developers?yes/no and why?
Answer: Yes because Github is a cloud-based hosting service for Git repositories. It makes it easier for the individual and team to use Git for version control and provide collaboration features such as task management, bug tracking and feature request for every project. Also Git is an immensely popular Version Control System, which allows developers to create a history of changes that occur over time in their code.
